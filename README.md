# A simple Game of Life implementation.

Requirements:

    A cell can be made "alive".

    A cell can be "killed".

    A cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies of under-population.

    A cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

    A cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies of overcrowding.

    An empty cell with exactly 3 live neighbours "comes to life".

    The board should wrap.
